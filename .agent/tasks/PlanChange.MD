# Plan Upgrade/Downgrade Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of smooth plan upgrade and downgrade logic for CueMe subscription management.

**Status:** üü° IN PROGRESS
**Created:** 2025/10/12
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## 1. Plan Tiers

| Plan | Price | File Limit | Q&A per File | Monthly Question Limit |
|------|-------|------------|--------------|------------------------|
| Free | ¬•0 | 1 | 5 | 10 |
| Basic | ¬•750 | 5 | 20 | 200 |
| Premium | ¬•2500 | 20 | 30 | 1000 |

---

## 2. Business Requirements

### Upgrade Logic

**Immediate Effect:**
- When a user upgrades (e.g., Free ‚Üí Basic / Basic ‚Üí Premium), the new limits and features apply immediately.

**Billing:**
- The billing cycle restarts on the upgrade date.
- The user is charged the full new plan price immediately, and the next renewal date is one month from that day.
- Any previous remaining time on the old plan is not credited (simplifies logic and avoids payment complexity).

**Usage Carry-Over:**
- All files, Q&A, and usage history remain intact. The user simply gains access to the higher limits.

### Downgrade Logic

**Effective Timing:**
- Downgrades take effect at the end of the current billing period. Until then, users keep their current plan benefits.

**After Downgrade Takes Effect:**
- If usage exceeds new limits, users can view existing data but cannot add new files or Q&A until within the new limit.
- Question counters reset to the new plan's quota at the start of the next cycle.

**User Control:**
- Users can cancel a scheduled downgrade before it takes effect (subscription continues as-is).
- If user upgrades while downgrade is scheduled, the scheduled downgrade is automatically cancelled.

**File Selection:**
- Users select which files to keep when the downgrade actually executes (not when scheduling).
- File selection happens at the end of the billing period.

---

## 3. Technical Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database Schema Changes ‚è≥

#### Task 1.1: Create `scheduled_plan_changes` Table
**Purpose:** Track pending plan changes that will execute at a future date.

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE scheduled_plan_changes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  current_plan_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES subscription_plans(id),
  target_plan_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES subscription_plans(id),
  change_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (change_type IN ('upgrade', 'downgrade')),
  scheduled_date TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'completed', 'cancelled')),
  stripe_subscription_id TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_changes_user ON scheduled_plan_changes(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_changes_status ON scheduled_plan_changes(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_scheduled_changes_date ON scheduled_plan_changes(scheduled_date) WHERE status = 'pending';
```

**RLS Policies:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE scheduled_plan_changes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own scheduled changes"
  ON scheduled_plan_changes FOR SELECT
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can cancel their own scheduled changes"
  ON scheduled_plan_changes FOR UPDATE
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

#### Task 1.2: Modify `user_subscriptions` Table
**Purpose:** Link to pending plan changes.

**Migration:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE user_subscriptions
ADD COLUMN pending_plan_change_id UUID REFERENCES scheduled_plan_changes(id) ON DELETE SET NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_user_subscriptions_pending_change ON user_subscriptions(pending_plan_change_id);
```

**Files to Create:**
- `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_add_scheduled_plan_changes.sql`

---

### Phase 2: Upgrade Flow Enhancement ‚è≥

#### Task 2.1: Update Stripe Checkout for Immediate Billing Restart
**File:** `src/app/api/subscriptions/checkout/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- For upgrades from existing paid plan: Use `stripe.subscriptions.update()` instead of creating new checkout
- Set `proration_behavior: 'always_invoice'` to charge immediately
- Set `billing_cycle_anchor: 'now'` to restart billing cycle
- For upgrades from Free: Continue using checkout session (current behavior)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Check if user has existing Stripe subscription
const { data: currentSub } = await supabase
  .from('user_subscriptions')
  .select('stripe_subscription_id, subscription_plans(price_jpy)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .single()

if (currentSub?.stripe_subscription_id && currentSub.subscription_plans.price_jpy > 0) {
  // Upgrade existing subscription
  await stripe.subscriptions.update(currentSub.stripe_subscription_id, {
    items: [{ price: plan.stripe_price_id }],
    proration_behavior: 'always_invoice',
    billing_cycle_anchor: 'now',
  })
  // Return success without checkout
} else {
  // Create new checkout session (current behavior)
}
```

#### Task 2.2: Cancel Any Pending Downgrades on Upgrade
**File:** `src/app/api/subscriptions/checkout/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Before processing upgrade, check for pending downgrades
- Cancel any pending downgrades
- Update Stripe subscription to remove `cancel_at_period_end` if set

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Cancel any pending downgrades
const { data: pendingChange } = await supabase
  .from('scheduled_plan_changes')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('status', 'pending')
  .eq('change_type', 'downgrade')
  .single()

if (pendingChange) {
  await supabase
    .from('scheduled_plan_changes')
    .update({ status: 'cancelled' })
    .eq('id', pendingChange.id)
  
  // Remove cancel_at_period_end from Stripe
  if (pendingChange.stripe_subscription_id) {
    await stripe.subscriptions.update(pendingChange.stripe_subscription_id, {
      cancel_at_period_end: false
    })
  }
}
```

#### Task 2.3: Verify Immediate Effect in Success Page
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/subscription/success/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Already implemented in STRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATE_FIX.md
- Verify that new plan limits are immediately available
- Show confirmation of new billing cycle start date

---

### Phase 3: Downgrade Flow Overhaul ‚è≥

#### Task 3.1: Create Schedule Downgrade API Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/subscriptions/schedule-downgrade/route.ts` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Schedule a downgrade to execute at the end of the current billing period.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Authenticate user
  // 2. Get current subscription and billing period end date
  // 3. Validate target plan
  // 4. Create scheduled_plan_changes record
  // 5. Update Stripe subscription with cancel_at_period_end: true
  // 6. Link scheduled change to user_subscriptions
  // 7. Return scheduled date and confirmation
}
```

**Key Logic:**
- Get `current_period_end` from Stripe subscription
- Set `scheduled_date` to `current_period_end`
- Update Stripe: `stripe.subscriptions.update(subId, { cancel_at_period_end: true })`
- Store in `scheduled_plan_changes` with status 'pending'
- Do NOT select files yet (happens at execution time)

#### Task 3.2: Create Cancel Scheduled Downgrade Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/subscriptions/cancel-scheduled-downgrade/route.ts` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Allow users to cancel a pending downgrade.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Authenticate user
  // 2. Find pending downgrade
  // 3. Update status to 'cancelled'
  // 4. Update Stripe subscription: cancel_at_period_end: false
  // 5. Clear pending_plan_change_id from user_subscriptions
  // 6. Return success
}
```

#### Task 3.3: Create Execute Scheduled Downgrade Endpoint
**File:** `src/app/api/subscriptions/execute-downgrade/route.ts` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Execute a scheduled downgrade (called by webhook or cron).

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function POST(request: NextRequest) {
  // 1. Verify this is called by webhook or internal cron
  // 2. Get scheduled downgrade by ID
  // 3. Check if file selection is needed
  // 4. If yes, return requiresFileSelection: true
  // 5. If files provided, deactivate excess files
  // 6. Update user_subscriptions to target plan
  // 7. Mark scheduled change as 'completed'
  // 8. Reset monthly question counter
}
```

**Note:** This endpoint can be called in two ways:
- By webhook when subscription period ends
- By user when they complete file selection

#### Task 3.4: Update Downgrade Page for Scheduling
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/subscription/downgrade/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Remove immediate downgrade logic
- Show "Schedule Downgrade" instead of "Confirm Downgrade"
- Display scheduled date (end of current billing period)
- Show message: "Your downgrade will take effect on [DATE]. You'll keep your current plan benefits until then."
- Add "Cancel" button to return to subscription page
- Do NOT show file selection yet

**New Flow:**
1. User clicks "Downgrade" on subscription page
2. Downgrade page shows scheduled date and confirmation
3. User confirms ‚Üí downgrade is scheduled
4. Redirect to subscription page with success message
5. Subscription page shows "Scheduled Downgrade" badge

#### Task 3.5: Create Downgrade Execution Page
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/subscription/execute-downgrade/page.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Handle file selection when downgrade actually executes.

**Flow:**
1. User receives email/notification when billing period ends
2. User logs in and sees banner: "Your downgrade is ready. Please select files to keep."
3. User clicks banner ‚Üí redirected to this page
4. User selects files (similar to current downgrade page)
5. User confirms ‚Üí downgrade executes immediately
6. Redirect to subscription page

**Alternative:** Auto-execute downgrade and show file selection modal on next login if needed.

---

### Phase 4: Webhook Integration ‚è≥

#### Task 4.1: Handle `customer.subscription.updated` Event
**File:** `src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Changes:**
- Detect when `cancel_at_period_end` changes to `true` (downgrade scheduled)
- Detect when subscription actually cancels (period ends)
- Trigger downgrade execution when period ends

**Implementation:**
```typescript
case 'customer.subscription.updated':
  const subscription = event.data.object as Stripe.Subscription
  
  // Check if subscription is ending
  if (subscription.cancel_at_period_end && subscription.status === 'active') {
    // Downgrade is scheduled, already handled by schedule-downgrade endpoint
    console.log('Downgrade scheduled for:', new Date(subscription.current_period_end * 1000))
  }
  
  // Check if subscription just ended
  if (subscription.status === 'canceled' || subscription.ended_at) {
    // Find pending downgrade for this subscription
    const { data: scheduledChange } = await supabase
      .from('scheduled_plan_changes')
      .select('*')
      .eq('stripe_subscription_id', subscription.id)
      .eq('status', 'pending')
      .single()
    
    if (scheduledChange) {
      // Execute the downgrade
      await executeScheduledDowngrade(scheduledChange.id)
    }
  }
  break
```

#### Task 4.2: Create Downgrade Execution Helper
**File:** `src/lib/downgrade-executor.ts` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Centralized logic for executing downgrades.

**Implementation:**
```typescript
export async function executeScheduledDowngrade(changeId: string) {
  // 1. Get scheduled change details
  // 2. Check if file selection is needed
  // 3. If yes, send notification to user and wait
  // 4. If no, execute immediately:
  //    - Update user_subscriptions to target plan
  //    - Mark scheduled change as 'completed'
  //    - Reset monthly question counter
  //    - Send confirmation email
}

export async function executeDowngradeWithFiles(changeId: string, keepFileIds: string[]) {
  // 1. Validate file selection
  // 2. Deactivate excess files
  // 3. Execute downgrade
}
```

---

### Phase 5: UI Updates ‚è≥

#### Task 5.1: Show Scheduled Downgrade on Subscription Page
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/subscription/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Fetch pending scheduled changes
- Show badge: "Scheduled Downgrade to [PLAN] on [DATE]"
- Add "Cancel Downgrade" button
- Show countdown: "X days until downgrade"
- Disable other plan change buttons while downgrade is scheduled

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const { data: pendingChange } = await supabase
  .from('scheduled_plan_changes')
  .select('*, target_plan:subscription_plans!target_plan_id(*)')
  .eq('user_id', user.id)
  .eq('status', 'pending')
  .single()

if (pendingChange) {
  // Show scheduled downgrade UI
}
```

#### Task 5.2: Add Downgrade Notification Banner
**File:** `src/app/dashboard/layout.tsx` or `src/components/DowngradeNotificationBanner.tsx` (NEW)

**Purpose:** Notify users when downgrade is ready for file selection.

**Implementation:**
- Check for pending downgrades past scheduled_date
- Show banner: "Your downgrade is ready. Please select files to keep."
- Link to execute-downgrade page

#### Task 5.3: Update Usage Enforcement
**File:** `src/lib/usage-enforcement.ts`

**Changes:**
- Ensure usage checks use CURRENT plan, not scheduled target plan
- Users keep full benefits until downgrade executes

**Verification:**
```typescript
// Always use current plan from user_subscriptions, ignore pending changes
const { data: subscription } = await supabase
  .from('user_subscriptions')
  .select('subscription_plans(*)')
  .eq('user_id', userId)
  .single()

// Use subscription.subscription_plans limits, NOT pending change limits
```

---

### Phase 6: Email Notifications ‚è≥

#### Task 6.1: Downgrade Scheduled Confirmation Email
**Trigger:** When user schedules a downgrade
**Content:**
- Confirmation that downgrade is scheduled
- Date when downgrade will take effect
- Current plan benefits remain until that date
- Link to cancel downgrade

#### Task 6.2: Downgrade Ready Email
**Trigger:** When billing period ends and downgrade is ready
**Content:**
- Downgrade is ready to execute
- If file selection needed: Link to select files
- If no selection needed: Confirmation that downgrade completed

#### Task 6.3: Downgrade Completed Email
**Trigger:** After downgrade executes
**Content:**
- Confirmation of new plan
- New limits and features
- Link to upgrade if needed

## 10. Bug Fixes

### Issue #1: Invalid Date Error on Downgrade Scheduling (2025/10/12)

**Error:** `RangeError: Invalid time value` when scheduling downgrade

**Root Cause:** 
- Stripe subscription's `current_period_end` property was undefined or null
- Code attempted to create Date object from undefined value
- No validation before calling `toISOString()`

**Fix Applied:**
- Added validation to check if `current_period_end` exists and is a valid number
- Added fallback to use `current_period_end` from database if Stripe value is invalid
- Added final fallback to use 30 days from now if both sources fail
- Added validation before creating scheduled change record
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/api/subscriptions/schedule-downgrade/route.ts`

### UI Updates (2025/10/12)

**Changes:**
- Translated all plan names to Japanese (Free ‚Üí „Éï„É™„Éº, Basic ‚Üí „Éô„Éº„Ç∑„ÉÉ„ÇØ, Premium ‚Üí „Éó„É¨„Éü„Ç¢„É†)
- Updated color scheme from blue/purple to cream/dark green theme
